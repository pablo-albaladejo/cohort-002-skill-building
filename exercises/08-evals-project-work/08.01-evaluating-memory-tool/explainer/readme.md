The theory behind this one is that we want to evaluate the memory tool. In other words, evaluate how memories are created and how often they're created.

We want to score as we want to score first of all whether a memory was created. We want to score its length, and that will probably do initially.

We could add an extra exercise here to add an LLM as a judge/score.
