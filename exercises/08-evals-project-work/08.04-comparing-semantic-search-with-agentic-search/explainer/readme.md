The theory behind this exercise is: Can we get more juice by splitting our retrieval algorithm into two pieces, a BM25 tool and a semantic search tool?

Can we get even more juice by exposing more of the internals to the LLM itself, i.e. allowing it to search for users or for subject lines or for linking emails to previous emails to get the entire thread?

The theory is, can we get the LLM to perform better by giving it a more diverse set of tools?
