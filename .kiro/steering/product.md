# Product Overview

This is a 5-day AI workshop repository for building a production-ready personal assistant in TypeScript. The course teaches advanced AI engineering patterns through hands-on exercises and project work.

## Core Learning Areas

- **Retrieval (Days 1-2)**: RAG fundamentals, BM25 keyword search, semantic embeddings, rank fusion, chunking, reranking, and agentic search patterns
- **Memory (Day 3)**: Persistent memory systems with CRUD operations, semantic recall, working memory, and episodic memory from conversations
- **Evaluation (Day 4)**: Systematic testing with Evalite framework, deterministic scorers, LLM-as-judge patterns, and A/B testing
- **Human-in-the-Loop (Day 5)**: Approval flows for destructive actions, thread-scoped permissions, and MCP server integrations

## Exercise Structure

Each section follows a **skill-building → project-work** pattern:

- **Skill-building exercises**: `problem/`, `solution/`, `explainer/` folders with focused technique learning
- **Project-work exercises**: Apply learned techniques to build a real personal assistant codebase
- **Datasets**: Email corpus (75-547 emails) and TypeScript documentation for realistic testing

The assistant progressively gains capabilities: search → memory → evaluation → safe action execution.
