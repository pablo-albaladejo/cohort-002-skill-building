Building your own dataset will be fun if you want to. I'm keen to allow people to use whatever dataset they want. It's quite simple to create a dataset from your own emails in Gmail, and we should provide a way to do that. Other people may have datasets they already have access to, like past chat conversations, or they may simply want to use the pre-built stuff. If you do want to use the pre-built stuff, you can just skip this exercise.
